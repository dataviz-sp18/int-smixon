I am moving to Michigan this Autumn and I was interested in learning more about some of the state's most pressing social issues. Unemployment is still a chronic problem in the state, and this tends to have a negative impact on children. Using the data from the American Community Survey (accessed through the `tidycensus` package), I was able to see that child poverty is clustered around Detroit, a city still struggling to rebuild itself. 

I chose to represent this in the form of a map because I believe that this type of data better represented spatially. And, while this is still beginning stages of analysis, there does seem to be some spatial correlation.

The leaflet app allows the user to see a pop-up of each county's name, as well as, zoom in / out and move around the map. A data table is also included that lets the user see child poverty and population values for each county.
